# Simulating pathways and mutual exclusivity

## Atuhors: Blanca Lacruz Pleguezuelos, Víctor Mateo Cáceres, Manuel Moradiellos Corpus

This was an exercise for the course Programming and Statistics with R (Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), course 2020-21.
An implementation of the package [OncoSimulR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/OncoSimulR.html) to show some examples and limitations of data simulations from models of [colorectal cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27936934/) and [glioblastoma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21908773/).

All the figures were obtained and modified from those papers; the slides were our own work.
