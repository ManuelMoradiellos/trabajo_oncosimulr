# Simulating pathways and mutual exclusivity

### Atuhors: Blanca Lacruz Pleguezuelos, Víctor Mateo Cáceres, Manuel Moradiellos Corpus

This was an exercise for the course Programming and Statistics with R (Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), course 2020-21.
An implementation of the package [OncoSimulR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/OncoSimulR.html) to show some examples and limitations of data simulations from models of [colorectal cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27936934/) and [glioblastoma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21908773/).

In this respository you can find the .Rmd file to build the vignettes, and its accompanying .bib and .css file (from [OncoSimulR](https://github.com/rdiaz02/OncoSimul) repo). 
All the figures were obtained and modified from the papers mentioned (referenced in the vignette); the slides were our own work.
